mediaCount is a demo written by a hobbyist to try out and show off some of the capabilities of Harvard LibraryCloud.
LibraryCloud makes openly available Harvard's information about the almost thirteen million items in its combined collections (73 libraries plus a large off-campus repository), and more. Any developer can use this rich set of information to create applications like mediaCount (except better) without asking permission or making special arrangements. LibraryCloud is at this point (Sept. 2014) a pilot that we hope will become a maintained part of Harvard Library's infrastructure.
mediaCount is an Open Source project (as is LibraryCloud). The laughable source code is on Github. If you hit bugs (you will) or have suggestions, send an email to me at david@weinberger.org. Thanks! -- David Weinberger, Nov. 1, 2014

mediaCount shows you the breakdown of items by media type within any set of subjects you search the Harvard Library collection for. Enter a keyword for a subject in the search box. Press the big blue plus sign to add another term. Click the X next to a search box to delete it. This demo app is using the live Harvard LibraryCloud API to get its data.
